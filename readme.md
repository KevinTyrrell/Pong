Pong

Game created by Liam Jensen and Kevin Tyrrell using JavaFX. 

Game features bare-bones pong functionality with detailed trajectory and slope calculations. All ball movement and collision relies on the sin and cos functions. The game's units is in degrees, not radians.

Needed features:
* Improved collision (360 degree collision)
* Better physics (ex, fast moving bumper hits ball at angle, ball goes faster)
* Pong Scoring
* Power-Ups / Modes?
